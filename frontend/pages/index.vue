        Tururu, that's Hawiiiiiian for
        <code>surprise</code>. If you order one, you will not know beforehand

        for people you don't reaaally know.

        They are 10 EUR each and 100% of our proceeds will be used to fund world

        <br />
        <code>world-peace-supporter-certificate</code>
        <br />
        <br />

        So be like Gandhi, Mother Theresa, and us and
